## NFT VXN Objective

NFT VXN’s objective is to promote global female artistic empowerment and advancement through technology. It is an online gallery and sales platform for female artists and designers to sell their one of a kind art and design works, in digital or tangible form at either an auction or set price through NFTs.  Artist royalties, determined by the artist, will be embedded into the NFTs guaranteeing that the artist is rewarded for her work at every resale.  Every NFT purchase will be made in ether. NFT VXN will take a modest  4% purchase fee, 3% of which will go to cover the operations, and 1% will be converted into VXN native ERC-20 token, in order to help fund our VXN Lair Foundation. The purpose of the VXN Lair is to fund art-through-tech education, curatorial and residency programs, as well as grants and collaborations for female artists globally.  With both NFT VXN and NFT Lair we aim to help transform female artist lives by exposure to a new crypto-audience, increase their sales, and earn the deserved recognition across the digital media-scape.

## Crowdsale

One to two months prior to the official launch of NFTVXN.com we will hold our native (ERC-20) VXN crowdsale. Its objective is to help fund the software development, marketing and advertising budgets, and cover operating costs. The duration of the sale will be 4 weeks and initial offering is at 20 cents per VXN token. The payment will be accepted in the form of ether. The outcome of the crowd sale will be indicative of public interest in the NFT VXN project, and will allow us to adjust our business model accordingly.
